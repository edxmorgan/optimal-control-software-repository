# Optimal Control Software Repository

Welcome to the **Optimal Control Software Repository**, a curated collection of tools and software packages for optimization and control. These tools support a wide range of applications, including model predictive control, dynamic optimization, embedded solvers, and systems with nonsmooth dynamics.

Before diving into the list, consider exploring the [**PLATO Optimization Software Guide**](https://plato.asu.edu/guide.html) — a decision tree resource that helps identify appropriate software for your optimization problem. Maintained by Arizona State University, PLATO categorizes both public domain and open academic tools, with emphasis on problem classes and licensing. It is especially helpful if you’re unsure which solver or package is right for your need

### [casiopeia](https://github.com/adbuerger/casiopeia)
**Keywords**: Parameter Estimation, Experimental Design

casiopeia holds a user-friendly environment for optimum experimental design and parameter estimation and identification applications. It does so by providing Python classes that can be initialized with the problem specifications, while the computations can then easily be performed using the available class functions.

Please note: casiopeia makes use of the optimization framework [CasADi](http://www.casadi.org/). For casiopeia to work, you need CasADi version = 3.1.0 to be installed on your system, otherwise the installation of casiopeia will abort.

casiopeia is still in it's testing state, and does not yet contain all the features it will provide in future versions. Therefore, you should check for updates on a regular basis.

For an installation guide, a tutorial on how to use casiopeia and a detailed documentation, please visit the [manual pages](http://casiopeia.readthedocs.io/).
